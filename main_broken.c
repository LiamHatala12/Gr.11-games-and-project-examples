// Lab 2
// Prepared by: Spencer Ploeger
// ENGG*1410, F22
// This program contains some compile and runtime errors

// Use the debugging tools listed in the Lab 2 document (print, gdb, assertions) to find and fix the errors
// Deliverables:
// - Fix the program and demo it to a TA. Be prepared to show at least 2 debudding techniques
// - Write a brief lab report and submit it to the correct dropbox before the end of the lab
// - Your lab report needs to discuss the debudding techniques you used, as well as some of the errors you fixed. Where they compile or run time?
// Report can be very brief and informal, a page or less is okay.
